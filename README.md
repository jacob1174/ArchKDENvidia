# Arch KDE with Nvidia video drivers

KDE scripts for Arch Linux systems

I create these scripts to start a process, go eat lunch, take a nap, and return to a completed process

I would like to thank Erik Dubois at ArcoLinux in giving me advice and assistance for creating these files and giving me inspiration to make the necessary changes to support my needs.
